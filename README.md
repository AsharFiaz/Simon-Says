# SIMON SAYS
The project is about creating a game using JAVA SCRPIT only n order to have a fine grip at it 
You can simply fork it and run it on your local machine easily 
The game is about blinking a colored box randomly and user has to keep track of all the blinked color boxes in order and if he/she fails to remember it then he/she loses.
